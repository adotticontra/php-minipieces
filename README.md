#php-minipieces

##What is minipieces?
Minipieces is a toy template engine for PHP and I wrote it to have some
kind of aiding tool handy when I need to develop some PHP driven website.

##How does it work?
Minipieces is built around a template class which, as the name implies,
allow you to process templates and obtain the desired output. Templates
can have any level of complexity, since pure PHP is used as a templating
language.

Please note that Minipieces checks a little and enforces noting;
separating logic from presentation is up to the developer.

Please read the `manual.txt` file included in the `doc` directory for
more information and usage examples.
