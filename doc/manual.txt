HOW TO USE minipieces
---------------------

First thing you have to do to use minipieces is to put the following
line whenever you plan to use it:

require_once("/path/to/lib/minipieces.php");

CREATE A BASIC TEMPLATE
-----------------------

First of all you have to create your template. minipieces uses PHP as the
templating language, so a simple template would look like this:

---
Hello <?=$name?>, this is a simple template!
---

Suppose it is saved in the simple.tpl file.

Now, in your code, you need to create a new minipiece object:

$template = new minipiece('/path/to/template/directory/simple.tpl');

This will give you a minipiece object binded to your template file. An
expection is thrown if there are problems accessing the template file
(non existent file, wrong permissions etc.).
